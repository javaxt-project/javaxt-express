<title>Express Demo</title>

<h1>Welcome!</h1>
<p>
Express is a simple web server built using <a href="http://www.javaxt.com/" target="_blank">JavaXT</a>. 
It is intended to help developers to get a web server up and running quickly. 
If you're reading this page, you're well on your way!
</p>

<p>
This demo has several cool features:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Dynamically generated content</li>
    <li>Sliding navigation via a carousel control</li>
    <li>URL rewriting via HTML5 push/pop state</li>
    <li>Fail-safe fallback for browsers that don't have javascript enabled</li>
    <li>Automated versioning of js and css files for proper caching</li>
</ul>


<h2>How to customize this site?</h2>
<p>
Now that you have your server up, you are ready to start adding content.
Individual web pages are assembled using html and text files found in the web 
directory. These files contain html snippets which are then wrapped in a template 
found in the &quot;style&quot; folder. 
</p>

<p>
You can start by opening one of the html files in the web directory (e.g. index.html) 
and edit the content. You do not have to restart the server to see the changes. 
Instead, you can simply refresh the browser. Don't worry, the server is smart enough to 
send the correct caching directives to the client. 
</p>

<p>
You can also start playing with the layout and style of your website by editing the 
&quot;template.html&quot; and &quot;style.css&quot; files.
</p>

<p>
Finally, you can add and remove tabs by updating the tabs.txt file. Note that the
tab file has a &lt;%=Path&gt; tag. This tag will be replaced with a relative path 
to the root directory. This is handy when hosting/supporting subsites. There are
many similar tags. You can learn more <a href="/wiki/known_tags/">here</a>.
