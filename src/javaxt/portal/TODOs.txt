General TODOs

(1) Document tree should open automatically to the class specified in the url.
    Need to add a method to the Documentation class to return the corresponding
    node and update the session variable.

(2) Tree.js bug: Join icons are not showing up in FF and Safari

(3) Implement subnavbar

(4) Add support for html extension for wiki files. This will provide a better
    html editing via the IDE. As a workaround, in Netbeans, you can change the
    file association for text files from plain/text to text/html. Example:
    Tools -> Options -> Files - > File Associations
